A hands-on portfolio project showcasing how to design, populate and transform a relational database using Supabase and SQL. The project simulates a simplified e-commerce platform with key data tables such as customers, orders and products.

- The goal is to demonstrate practical skills in:

- Creating and managing a PostgreSQL database with Supabase

- Loading and cleaning raw data from CSV files

- Performing SQL-based transformations and analyses

- Using Python (Jupyter Notebooks) to query, manipulate and visualise the data

The main goal of this project is to showcase data engineering, analysis and SQL skills in a real-world business context.
